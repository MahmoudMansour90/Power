# Power Risk Index for Data Center Construction Planning (v3.1)

MOCCI -- interactive Cost and Reliability pillar explorer, built on real EIA-861
data through 2025. Availability (Capacity) and the Composite Power Risk Index
are shown as honest placeholders -- no synthetic or invented numbers for
either, until those pillars have real, validated results.

One page, one URL, with a tab per pillar (Cost / Reliability / Availability /
Composite) -- no separate page URLs to navigate between.

## v3.1 -- map rework, fixing real bugs found after deploying v3

After v3 was deployed and tested for real, the map had genuine bugs that
this sandbox's own testing could never have caught (its map rendering could
not be visually verified here at all -- see "A verification note on the
maps" below, carried over from v3). Every one of these is fixed by
rebuilding the map on a different architecture, not patched:

- **State borders no longer mask the county data or block clicks.** Root
  cause: the map was a Plotly *animation* (one frame per year); only the
  very first frame actually carried the county geometry, so every other
  year rendered no county shapes at all -- and nothing to click. The map is
  now a single static choropleth, fully rebuilt on every rerun when the
  year changes. There is no animation anywhere anymore.
- **Alaska and Hawaii are now structurally impossible to show**, not just
  cropped out of view. Root cause: Plotly's `scope='usa'` basemap draws
  AK/HI inset boxes as a fixed part of that basemap, regardless of any
  view-window cropping. That basemap is now turned off entirely
  (`visible=False`); the map shows only our own county choropleth and our
  own state-border lines (dissolved from the same AK/HI-free county
  geometry in `data_prep.py`'s `build_state_borders()`). With no AK/HI
  geometry anywhere in either trace, there's nothing left to draw.
- **Search is back to two dropdowns** -- State, then County (with its
  FIPS) -- replacing the single combined search box.
- **The detail panel always shows the latest actual/observed year**,
  regardless of which year the map slider is on, and regardless of whether
  it was opened by a map click or by searching.
- **The year slider marks every 2 years** (not every single year) with a
  small ruler under the slider, and **forecast-year labels are colored
  differently** from actual-year labels. Every single year is still
  individually selectable via the slider itself -- the ruler is a visual
  guide alongside it.
- **No mention of the specific forecast model's name** anywhere in the UI.
- **No download affordances anywhere** -- chart image export is removed
  from every chart's toolbar, and table CSV/clipboard export is disabled
  app-wide (`.streamlit/config.toml`).

## What was new in v3 (still true in v3.1)

- **2025 data included.** Cost now runs 2001-2025 with a 2026-2028 forecast;
  Reliability now runs 2013-2025 with a 2026-2028 projection.
- **Cost now carries `Reporting_Utilities`** (utility names serving each
  county-year, largest first), matching Reliability's existing convention.
- **Contiguous U.S. only.**
- **Thicker, darker state borders** (now the app's own line trace -- see above).
- **No "About this data and methodology" section anywhere** -- removed per
  request; backtest scorecards, disclosures, and the CRI 100-ceiling
  explanation are gone from the UI.
- **No 68%/CI-level/likely-range/probability numbers shown anywhere** -- not
  in the hover tooltip, the click panel, or the search panel. Forecast years
  are tagged "(forecast)" only. The shaded uncertainty band stays on the
  trend chart as a visual, with no numeric label attached to it.
- **No confidence grade shown anywhere**, and the "no data" legend is a
  single short line ("Gray = not available (no reporting).").
- **Map click and county search open the same detail panel**, always at the
  latest actual/observed year (see v3.1 above). Search additionally shows a
  couple of extra fields (national rank, total volume / years of history)
  that the click panel does not.
- **National comparison stat added for Cost** (`Pct_Counties_MoreExpensive_SameYear`,
  computed once in `data_prep.py`), mirroring Reliability's own pre-computed
  `Pct_Counties_Less_Reliable_SameYear`. Both are scoped to observed years only.

## What's in this folder

- `app.py` -- main entry point: password gate, header, scope banner, tabs
- `cost_pillar.py`, `reliability_pillar.py` -- each real pillar's page, as
  its own module so they stay easy to work on independently
- `availability_pillar.py`, `composite_pillar.py` -- honest "not yet
  available" placeholders
- `map_utils.py` -- shared choropleth styling: the static (non-animated)
  per-rerun choropleth, the app's own state-border line trace, the
  every-2-years year ruler, click-to-FIPS resolution, and the "no data"
  gray-band colorscale -- used by both real pillars' maps
- `data_prep.py` -- regenerates the files in `data/` from each pillar's
  notebook outputs (run this again whenever a pillar's underlying data is
  refreshed) -- see the top of that file for the exact input filenames.
  Also dissolves the county boundary file into `state_borders.json` (see
  `build_state_borders()`).
- `data/` -- the static data snapshot the app actually loads: parquet files
  per pillar, plus `counties_fips.json` (contiguous-US-only county boundary
  file, includes Connecticut's 2022+ planning regions) and
  `state_borders.json` (per-state boundary lines, dissolved from the same
  county file)
- `assets/mocci_logo.png` -- the MOCCI logo (password screen + header)
- `.streamlit/secrets.toml.example` -- template for the password secret
- `.streamlit/config.toml` -- disables table CSV/clipboard export app-wide
- `requirements.txt`

## Password protection

Gated by a single shared password, checked against `st.secrets["app_password"]`.
The real password is never stored in this folder or in source control --
only `secrets.toml.example` (a template) is included.

**Local run:** copy `.streamlit/secrets.toml.example` to
`.streamlit/secrets.toml` and put a real password in it. That file is
already in `.gitignore`.

**Streamlit Community Cloud:** no `secrets.toml` file needed in the repo.
After deploying, go to the app's **Settings -> Secrets** and paste:
```
app_password = "your real password here"
```

## Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud

1. Create a new GitHub repository and push everything in this folder to it
   (the `data/` folder and logo included).
2. Go to https://share.streamlit.io/, connect your GitHub account.
3. Select the repository, branch `main`, main file path `app.py`, deploy.
4. Set the password in the app's Secrets before sharing the link.

## Run locally

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Updating a pillar's data later

Each pillar's notebook is the source of truth; this app never recomputes
anything, only reshapes and displays what the notebook already validated.

1. Rerun the relevant pillar's notebook, producing fresh output files.
2. Place those fresh files alongside `data_prep.py` (see the paths at the
   top of that script).
3. Run `python3 data_prep.py` -- it regenerates every file in `data/`.
4. Commit and push the updated `data/` files. Streamlit Community Cloud
   redeploys automatically.

## A verification note on the maps

Every Plotly geo trace (`go.Choropleth`, `go.Scattergeo`, any
`projection_type`) fetches a base topology file from `cdn.plot.ly` at
render time, in the browser -- confirmed directly in this rebuild: the
request fires the same way for `'albers usa'` and for `'mercator'`, and
even with the basemap turned off (`visible=False`). This is how Plotly's
geo module works for every deployment, not something specific to this app.
In the sandboxed environment this app was built in, that CDN host is
blocked by the sandbox's own network policy, so **the map itself (the
colored county shapes and the state-border lines) could not be rendered or
visually inspected there, in either v3 or this v3.1 rework.** This is the
same limitation disclosed in v3's README; it is unrelated to -- and not an
explanation for -- the bugs the user found after deploying v3, which were
real code bugs (see the v3.1 section above) now fixed and verified by other
means:

- The **colorscale/gray-band math** (the "no data" sentinel value landing in
  the reserved gray portion of the remapped colorscale) was verified
  directly with real numbers in Python, independent of rendering.
- The **state-border dissolution** (`build_state_borders()`) was verified
  visually offline with matplotlib (no CDN dependency) -- a clean,
  recognizable, AK/HI-free contiguous-US outline.
- Everything that doesn't depend on the geo trace rendering -- the colorbar
  itself (confirmed visible, correct scale and gray band), the year slider
  and its every-2-years/forecast-colored ruler, the two-dropdown search, the
  detail panel (confirmed for observed years, the "no data this year" case,
  and the "not enough history to project" case, on both pillars), and the
  comparison table -- was verified directly in a running instance of this
  app, including confirming no Python traceback occurs anywhere in that
  flow.

**What to confirm once deployed (or running locally with real network
access):** the map renders visible, contiguous-US-only county shapes;
Alaska/Hawaii do not appear anywhere, including no empty inset boxes; state
borders read clearly and no longer sit on top of / block the county colors;
a map click on any year (not just the default) opens the correct county's
detail panel; the year ruler's every-2-years marks and forecast-year
coloring look right under the slider; and no download icon appears on any
chart or table.

## Adding the Availability pillar or the Composite index later

Follow the same pattern as Cost and Reliability: once that pillar has a
validated notebook output, extend `data_prep.py` to export it, write a new
`availability_pillar.py` (or replace the composite placeholder) following
`reliability_pillar.py` as the template, and wire it into the matching tab
in `app.py` in place of the current placeholder import.
